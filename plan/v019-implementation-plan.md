# v019 Implementation Plan

## Core Purpose
This phase optimizes the segment search functionality in the route builder, improving performance and accuracy when finding nearby segments.

## Key Components
1. **Search Algorithm Optimization**
   - Implement spatial indexing for faster segment lookup
   - Add bounding box pre-filtering before distance calculations
   - Cache frequently accessed segments
   - Optimize distance calculations for one-way vs bidirectional segments

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Reduce unnecessary segment loading
   - Implement efficient point-to-segment distance calculations
   - Add segment caching for frequently accessed areas
   - Optimize memory usage during searches

## Success Criteria
- Segment search completes within 100ms for typical datasets
- Memory usage remains stable during extended use
- Search results are accurate within specified radius
- UI remains responsive during searches

## Technical Notes
- Consider using R-tree or similar spatial indexing
- Profile current implementation to identify bottlenecks
- Maintain existing functionality while improving performance
- Add performance metrics logging

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing:
  - `latlong2`
  - `provider`
