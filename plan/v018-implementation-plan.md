# v018 Implementation Plan

## Core Purpose
This phase implements track building functionality, enabling users to:
1. Add selected segments to the current track
2. Build a continuous route by connecting segments
3. Save the completed track

## Key Components
1. **Track Building**
   - Adds selected segment to the current track
   - Automatically adds connecting segments when needed
   - Maintains track continuity and direction
   - For one-way segments: preserves original direction
   - For bidirectional segments: if the connecting point was the start of the segment, then the segment is added to the track in its current direction, but if the connecting point was at the end of the segment, then the segment is reversed before adding it to the track

2. **Track Management**
   - Appends the selected segment to the end of the track, adding a connecting line segment if needed
   - Maintains a list of the segments which were added to the track
   - Allows the user to remove the last segment from the track

3. **Save Functionality**
   - Saves completed tracks to the database
   - Generates metadata:
     - Track name
     - Creation date
     - Total distance
     - Elevation profile
     - Segment count
   - Handles save errors and conflicts
   - Provides save status feedback

## Success Criteria
- Segments are correctly added to the track
- Connecting segments are properly inserted
- Track continuity is maintained
- Save functionality works reliably
- Error handling is robust
- Performance is maintained with long tracks

## Technical Notes
- Ensure proper segment connection handling
- Maintain track data integrity
- Handle save conflicts gracefully
- Follow existing styling patterns

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing:
  - `flutter_map`
  - `latlong2`
  - `provider`
