# v022 Implementation Plan

## Core Purpose
This phase implements the display of all segments in the library on the map, with visual highlighting for the currently selected segment.

## Key Components
1. **Map Display Updates**
   - Modify map view to show all segments simultaneously
   - Implement different visual styles for segments:
     - Normal segments: Standard line style
     - Selected segment: Highlighted style (thicker, different color)

2. **Visual Styling**
   - Define consistent color scheme:
     - All segments: System blue (#007AFF)
     - Selected segment: System blue (#007AFF) with thicker line
   - Implement line width variations:
     - Normal segments: 2px
     - Selected segment: 4px
   - Add markers for selected segment:
     - Start point: Red circle marker
     - End point: Green circle marker

## Success Criteria
- All segments visible on map simultaneously
- Clear visual distinction for selected segment
- Smooth performance with large segment collections
- Responsive interaction feedback
- Consistent visual styling across zoom levels
- Proper handling of overlapping segments

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing:
  - `flutter_map` for base map functionality
  - `latlong2` for coordinate handling
  - `provider` for state management
