# MapDesk v005 Implementation Plan: UI Improvements

## 🎯 MVP Scope

Building upon the segment creation functionality from v004, v005 will focus on improving the user interface and experience. This version will:

1. Enhance the segment creation workflow
2. Improve visual feedback and controls
3. Make the interface more intuitive
4. Optimize the user experience for track splitting

We will defer the following features to future versions:
- Route building from segments
- Route export functionality
- Advanced segment filtering and searching
- Complex segment metadata
- Route optimization
- Multiple route management
- Advanced UI customization

- Enhance visual feedback for loaded tracks
- Improve split mode activation
- Add clear visual indicators for active modes

### Split Mode Enhancements
- Intuitive segment boundary selection
- Clear visual feedback for selected points
- Improved segment naming workflow
- Better error state visualization
- Enhanced progress indicators

## 📝 User Stories

### 1. Improved Track Loading

**As a** user  
**I want to** easily load and visualize my GPX tracks  
**So that** I can quickly start working with my data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clear loading status indicators
- Immediate visual feedback on track load
- Intuitive error messages

**I want to** easily create segments from my tracks  
**So that** I can efficiently organize my routes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Intuitive point selection interface
- Clear visual feedback during splitting
- Streamlined segment naming process
- Immediate visual confirmation of saved segments

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### UI Component Updates
- Enhance existing widgets with better visual feedback
- Improve state management for split mode
- Add progress indicators
- Implement better error visualization

### User Experience Improvements
- Add tooltips and help text
- Implement smooth transitions
- Enhance visual hierarchy

## 🚀 Implementation Approach

This version will be implemented iteratively, with each UI improvement being:
1. Identified through user feedback
2. Designed for minimal complexity
3. Implemented and tested
4. Refined based on usage

## 📈 Success Metrics

The v005 update will be considered successful when:
1. Users can more easily load and work with tracks
2. Split mode is more intuitive to use
3. Visual feedback is clear and helpful
4. Error states are well communicated
5. Overall workflow feels smoother

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. Basic segment management only
2. Limited metadata support
3. No undo/redo functionality
4. Basic error handling
5. No route building features

## 🔄 Future Considerations

1. Advanced segment management
2. Route building capabilities
3. Enhanced metadata support
4. Undo/redo functionality
5. Advanced error recovery
6. Route statistics and analysis
