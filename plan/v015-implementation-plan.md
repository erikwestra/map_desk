# v015 Implementation Plan

## Core Purpose
This phase establishes the foundational structure for the route builder feature, focusing on:
1. Setting up the basic application state management
2. Creating the initial UI layout
3. Integrating with the existing application architecture

## Key Components
1. **State Management**
   - Defines the two possible states of the route builder:
     - `awaitingStartPoint`: Initial state, waiting for user to select a starting point
     - `choosingNextSegment`: User has selected a starting point and can choose the next segment

2. **Basic UI Structure**
   - Creates a split view layout with:
     - Map view on the left
     - Sidebar on the right (300px wide)
   - Implements a button panel at the bottom of the sidebar

3. **Application Integration**
   - Integrates with the existing application's provider system
   - Sets up the route builder as a new mode in the application

## Success Criteria
- Basic UI structure is in place
- State management is working
- Application integration is complete
- No errors or warnings
- Professional appearance

## Technical Notes
- Use existing `BaseMapView` for map display
- Follow Flutter/Dart naming conventions
- Implement proper state management
- Ensure clean separation of concerns
- Add appropriate documentation

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing:
  - `flutter_map`
  - `latlong2`
  - `provider`
